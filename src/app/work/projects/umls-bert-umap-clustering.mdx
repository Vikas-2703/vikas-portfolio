## Overview
Built an NLP pipeline to generate embeddings for medical concepts using **UMLS-BERT** and visualised semantic clustering using **UMAP**.

## Problem
Understanding how medical concepts relate semantically is critical for classification, retrieval, and downstream clinical NLP tasks.

## Approach
- Loaded UMLS datasets (MRCONSO, MRSTY)
- Filtered English preferred terms
- Mapped concepts → semantic groups
- Generated embeddings using pretrained **UMLS-BERT**
- Applied **UMAP** (cosine distance) for dimensionality reduction
- Visualised clusters by semantic group

## Results
- Clear separation of semantic groups in embedding space  
- Validated effectiveness of domain-specific embeddings  
- Demonstrated clustering for both UMLS vocabulary and pathology datasets  

## Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Transformers (BERT), UMAP, Matplotlib

## Impact
Demonstrates how embedding-based representations can support classification, search, and clinical decision-support systems.
